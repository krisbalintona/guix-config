# ** Snippets

# *** HTTP headers
# Many of these are for the sake of hardening.  Most of such settings
# were taken from
# https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples.

# Useful for accurate IP logging.  Use for domains behind a proxy,
# e.g. a VPN like Wireguard
(headers_wireguard) {
	header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}

	# Caddy by default already handles the X-Forwarded-For,
	# X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Proto headers
	# appropriately
}

(headers_security_global) {
	header {
		# Disallow sniffing of X-Content-Type-Options
		X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
		# Don't show full URLs when referred to another side
		Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
		# Server name removing
		-Server
		# Remove X-Powered-By though this shouldn't be an
		# issue, but better safe than sorry
		-X-Powered-By
	}
}

(headers_security_public) {
	header {
		# Make HTTPS mandatory over HTTP.  (Note: Assumes that
		# HTTPS and TLS is working properly.  Will get in the
		# way if TLS isn't working, e.g., during testing)
		Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000"
	}
}

(headers_security_private) {
	header {
		# Prevent search engines from indexing.  Should be
		# used for private domains that should not be indexed
		X-Robots-Tag "noindex, nofollow"
	}
}

# *** TLS

# DNS-01 ACME verification.  See
# https://caddy.community/t/how-to-use-dns-provider-modules-in-caddy-2/8148
# for Caddy-specific instructions.
#
# NOTE: For this to work, I need a build of Caddy that has the DNS
# module corresponding to my DNS provider.
#
# I use this method of certificate verification because I've
# configured my firewall to geo-block non-US IPs, so automatic the
# typical automatic means of verification fail.
#
# This domain is registered under Namecheap but I've directed
# Namecheap to use Netlify's DNS servers (since I host the domain on
# Netlify), so see the Netlify DNS challenge module for Caddy:
# https://github.com/caddy-dns/netlify.
#
# For Netlify, a personal API token should be used as the personal
# access token
(tls_dns_netlify) {
	tls {
		# Bind mint the access token file and reference the
		# path
