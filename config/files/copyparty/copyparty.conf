  # We isolate Copyparty in its own network container and use a
  # reverse proxy to direct traffic into this network. As such, client
  # IPs originate from within this network. To show actual IP
  # locations, we tell Copyparty to trust and make use of the
  # X-Forwarded-For HTTP header that Caddy attaches to its outgoing
  # traffic. (This assumes Caddy is receiving packets with the actual
  # IP; this is only true if Caddy is on the host network or receives
  # traffic from another reverse proxy that attached that header.) See
  # https://github.com/9001/copyparty?tab=readme-ov-file#reverse-proxy
  # for more information

# Create users.  I hash my passwords (--ah-alg).  I also have
# --usernames, meaning the hash below is the result of
# USERNAME:PASSWORD as the password inputted in e.g. --ah-gen and
